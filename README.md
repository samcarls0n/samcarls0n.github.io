# Odin Project - Landing Page

My second project for the Odin Project Foundations course. For this project I will be creating a landing page from scratch. I will be building upon the skills I used from my first project by implementing css styling and flexbox capabilities.

Second log -

I have successfully finished the landing page. Overall the project took me about a day to complete. I'm very pleased with how it turned out and feel as though I was able to apply all of the lessons that I have covered thus far. Using Google and Stack Overflow when I ran into issues was also very useful. I strayed a little bit while doing the hero section and opted for a background image instead. I'm looking forward to continuing to build my skills from here.
